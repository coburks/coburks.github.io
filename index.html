    <p>aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh
      yeah well, I know this page looks juvenile and silly as it stands, really amateur stuff. I'm just kind of updating it the more I learn about html/css/js blah blah blah
      It'll be fine i guess eventually but it's a fun little experiment. It's like every time i find something is cool and i start to learn more about it, the more
      i realize just how little I know and its frustrating. You take one step forward and it's like, "sick,  i'm walking this is nice" then you turn a corner and
      see like a tall ass mountain. What am i going to do with that? learn to climb? sure I guess but its much easier to just kinda hang out and do whatever but 
      then you see some asshole with a homeade flying machine traversing the mountain with ease and you realize you're just a sucker with two shoes.

    <p>i can see now that this probably looks a little unhinged but i promise it's just a stretched metaphor. and at least i can make a web browser display the 
      unhinged and terrible things that I write. not that it's complicated. or impressive. anyone can do it really. anyone can kinda do anything really we all
      just spend our time differently. I need to change that gnome image. havent decided what to yet. it might also be neat to post some timeline stuff like voice/face whatever
      could be interesting web content.

      i'm still a cat though
